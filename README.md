# getting-and-cleaning-data
This repo is specified for the Getting and Cleaning Data project. It includes three following files:
  
  First, a scrip called run_analysis.R, which has the following function:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set. 

2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 

3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set 

4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names. 

5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
  
  Second, CodeBook.md, which modifies and updates the available codebooks with the data to indicate all the variables 
and summaries calculated, along with units, and any other relevant information. 
  
  Third, Tidy.txt, which is the output of run_analysis.R
